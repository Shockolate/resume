Approximately one week was available before school was to be reopened for the Winter short Term. Cleanup of facilities and student personal property was to take about three weeks. Administration and faculty pooled their thoughts to produce a viable online learning experience for the 130 students spread across the state expecting to return to school. Teachers involved had not at this time been introduced to Course Management Software (CMS). Experiences in providing two weeks worth of quality, online-learning, put together in one week's time are documented through interview and observation.",
