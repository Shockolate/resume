Approximately one week was available before school was to be reopened for the Winter short Term. Cleanup of facilities and student personal property was to take about three weeks. Administration and faculty pooled their thoughts to produce a viable online learning experience for the 130 students spread across the state expecting to return to school. Teachers involved had not at this time been introduced to Course Management Software (CMS). Experiences in providing two weeks worth of quality, online-learning, put together in one week's time are documented through interview and observation.",

He assisted other members of the squad through pair programming, code reviews and knowledge sharing sessions. Ted's impact spread far beyond the team. He took over the running of design review sessions, leading to greater participation from all the teams involved and reclaiming time lost to inefficient processes. He was also a member of on-call rotations that provided indispensable service and required extensive knowledge of the company's systems. Ted went out of his way to build connections in a remote work environment, advocating for best practices around communication and often running squad bonding activities. All of this was driven by his commitment to personal and professional growth. Ted will be an invaluable member of any engineering organization he joins."

Ted delivered high-quality, maintainable, and testable code, demonstrating his expertise and attention to detail. Ted actively fostered a sense of camaraderie, especially in a remote work environment, by organizing engaging team-building activities and checking in on his team members. Ted's thoughtfulness, technical proficiency, and team-oriented nature make him a great candidate for any software organization."
