Approximately one week was available before school was to be reopened for the Winter short Term. Cleanup of facilities and student personal property was to take about three weeks. Administration and faculty pooled their thoughts to produce a viable online learning experience for the 130 students spread across the state expecting to return to school. Teachers involved had not at this time been introduced to Course Management Software (CMS). Experiences in providing two weeks worth of quality, online-learning, put together in one week's time are documented through interview and observation.",

I managed Ted at 6 River Systems and relied on his experience to help lead the team. He set the technical standard for the team with his combination of high quality code and domain expertise. He assisted other members of the squad through pair programming, code reviews and knowledge sharing sessions. Ted's impact spread far beyond the team. He took over the running of design review sessions, leading to greater participation from all the teams involved and reclaiming time lost to inefficient processes. He was also a member of on-call rotations that provided indispensable service and required extensive knowledge of the company's systems. Ted went out of his way to build connections in a remote work environment, advocating for best practices around communication and often running squad bonding activities. All of this was driven by his commitment to personal and professional growth. Ted will be an invaluable member of any engineering organization he joins."

Ted delivered high-quality, maintainable, and testable code, demonstrating his expertise and attention to detail. Ted actively fostered a sense of camaraderie, especially in a remote work environment, by organizing engaging team-building activities and checking in on his team members. Ted's thoughtfulness, technical proficiency, and team-oriented nature make him a great candidate for any software organization."

He is excellent engineer, one of the best I've worked with in my multiple decades in software engineering. He's also a great teacher, and was crucial in helping me learn the software stack when I joined the company. I can't thank him enough for the hours he spent with me, patiently explaining the subtleties of the complex systems we were responsible for. Finally, In addition to his skills as an engineer and a mentor, Ted took the lead in organizing team activities and games, something I appreciated greatly in a remote team."
